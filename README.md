People working on AEM typically use the AEM SDK JAR file locally for development and testing. Sometimes, it's necessary to run AEM in normal mode, while other times it's required to run it in debug mode. Running the AEM SDK in debug mode can be cumbersome, as it involves opening a terminal and copying and pasting commands to start the SDK in debug mode. Similarly, if someone is using a JDK ZIP file, starting the AEM SDK can present the same challenge.

**AEM Quick Launcher** is a batch script designed to address the issue described. It requires the path to the JAR file and the debug port number as inputs. Upon execution, the script presents a menu prompting the user to choose between starting AEM in normal mode or debug mode. Users can simply press keys to make their selection, making it very convenient. Additionally, the script streamlines the process for individuals using JDK ZIP files on their local systems to start AEM.

## Limitations
- Since it's a batch file, it will only work on Windows systems.
